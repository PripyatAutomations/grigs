This is a small gtk3 and perl frontend for rigctld.

Configuration will be created at ~/.config/rustyrigs.yaml or the location given by -f the first time its started and either settings/Save clicked or exited.

Install needed perl packages--

sudo apt install -y libgtk3-perl libglib-perl libyaml-perl libhamlib-perl libdata-structure-util-perl

---

You'll probably want to quiet down the debug level in the settings.


Things that are broken but should be fixed soon:
	Various settings aren't saved/applied properly, I'm aware.
