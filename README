----- This is broken for the next few days while I try to move the code around, feel free to jump in and pick up where I left off... -----

This is a small gtk3 and perl frontend for rigctld.

Configuration will be created at ~/.config/rustyrigs.yaml or the location given by -f the first time its started and either settings/Save clicked or exited.

Install needed perl packages--

sudo apt install -y libgtk3-perl libglib-perl libyaml-perl libhamlib-perl

This evolved in a kind of ugly direciton, but hopefully the code can get cleaned up a bit...
